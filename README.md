# Bayesian Inference Program
A program with multiple inference paradigms for bayesian networks.

## Supported Inference paradigms
* Variable Elimination

## Network File Format
Currently a non standard file format is used, using the bif file handle, which is already in use by the [bayes interchange format](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/labs/compbio/Repository/formats.html). In future versions we will try to move to the [dot format](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html), which is supported by graphviz.
